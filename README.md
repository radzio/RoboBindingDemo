RoboBindingDemo
===============

An android app to showcase the usage of <a href="https://github.com/RoboBindin/">RoboBinding</a> framework.

You will find example code for Activity, Fragment, ListView, custom bindings and attributes. 

This demo was created for my talk at <a href="http://droidcon.pl">Droidcon Krak√≥w</a> 2014.

The project can be directly imported into Android Studio.
